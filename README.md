# Crazy Scrapper

Hi there!

Here's another project done during [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) bootcamp.

We discovered how to implement a **scrapper**, as well as its potential.

In fact, there are 3 different scrappers in this repository, all using pretty much the same build composed of:
- [Nokogiri](https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri/versions/1.6.6.2?locale=fr) and [Rest-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client/versions/1.8.0?locale=fr), to easily access the HTML resource of a website.
- [XPath](https://rubygems.org/gems/xpath/versions/2.0.0?locale=fr) to target specific content of a given page.

## Set up 

1/ Get the resource:
  - Download the repository
  - OR `git clone https://github.com/kentsbrockman/Crazy-Scrapper`

2/ `cd Crazy-Scrapper`

3/ `bundle install`

4/ `cd Crazy-Scrapper/lib`

5/ `ruby [one of the 3 programs]`. For example, `ruby city_scrapper.rb`.
